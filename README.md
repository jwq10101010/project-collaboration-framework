# Project Collaboration Framework
This repository outlines a framework for software collaboration

## Bootstrap instructions

Implement a sign-up sheet where the project oversight and individual contributors can sign up and also include the project details. The number of sign-up sheets can scale up as needed depending on the size of the group.

For those looking for a mentorship opportunity, resume experience, or to find a hobby, run the “Curriculum template” flow.

For those looking to create an open-source project, startup, or non-profit organization, run the “Workplace template” flow.

## Curriculum template (to simulate a university course capstone project)

**Project overseer:** Overseer 1

**Mission statement:** The purpose of the app

**Level of experience required:** Newbie/Intermediate/Advanced

**Time commitment required:** Should be no more than 1 semester (15-17 weeks)

**Tech stack:** Programming languages/frameworks/tools

**Skills learned:**
-	Skill 1
-	Skill 2
-	…
-	Skill N

**MVP:** The core functionality required to launch the app

**Additional details:** Any other clarifications needed to explain the app

**Additional features to implement:** (if there is any interest or people can develop a fork and add these on their own time)
-	Feature 1
-	Feature 2
-	…
-	Feature N

**Individual contributors:**
-	IC 1
-	IC 2
-	…
-	IC N

**Project overseer:** Teresa Brown

**Mission statement:** Showcase the group’s interest(s) to the world by developing a website

**Level of experience required:** Newbie

**Time commitment required:** 4 weeks

**Tech stack:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**Skills learned:**
-	Team collaboration
-	Code repository management
-	Tech stack programming experience

**MVP:** Design a webpage introducing topic(s) of interest

**Additional details:** Keep the content clean

-	Implement filter functionality

**Individual contributors:**
-	Ella Vader
-	Chris P Bacon
-	Paige Turner
-	Tim Burr

## Curriculum notes for the project overseer
-	When developing the curriculum, limit the time commitment to 1 semester.
-	Gauge the experience level of the group: If they are self-starters, then just field any questions they have; if more newbie, may need to go over basic things like git repo management, SDLC best practices, etc. and also play a more active role in overseeing the project
-	Lay down the groundwork: make sure the group sits down and comes up with the design and technical requirements for their app BEFORE doing any coding.
-	For disagreements on the app design: look for a compromise. An example for web page, if everyone has different interests, consider developing a home page which links to each IC’s topic pages.
-	Avoid scope creep: gently remind the group that the MVP can be a barebones product meant to get started in their development journey or to experiment with a new tech stack

## Workplace template (to simulate working at a company)

**Key differences to curriculum template:**
-	Addition of optional Executives and Board Members
-	Potentially greater MVP scope
-	Time commitment: as long as the team members commit to the cause
-	Potentially make some revenue (startup) or create non-profit organization that would last beyond a semester at school

**Executives (startup/NPO only):** [CEO, CTO, CFO, COO, etc]

**Board members (startup/NPO only):** [Board Member 1,2,…,N]

**Project managers:** [Manager 1,2,…,N]

**Mission statement:** The purpose of the app

**Level of experience required:** C-Suite and Board Members should have experience already heading up an existing company. Junior-level devs should have some programming experience and senior-level devs are veterans that can play a more active role in the requirements and design phases.

**Time commitment required:** Varies

**Tech stack:** [Programming languages/frameworks/tools]

**MVP:** The core functionality required to launch the app

**Additional details:** Any other clarifications needed to explain the app

**Additional features to implement:** (if there is any interest or people can develop a fork and add these on their own time)
-	Feature 1
-	Feature 2
-	…
-	Feature N

**Individual contributors:**
-	IC 1
-	IC 2
-	…
-	IC N

## Workplace notes
-	Project can scale up and down in terms of team members as needed based on the org’s needs
-	Executives and board members optional if the focus is on producing open-source software
-	Startups and NPOs have regulatory and other requirements that need to be considered before work can progress
-	The project may require seed funding or an angel investment

## Future enhancements to the framework
-	Code repository licensing
-	Incorporating the template within SDLC methodology (Kanban, Agile, etc)
-	Feedback process
-	Pair programming
-	Skill gap assessment
-	Handling escalations
-	Cross-team collaboration
-	Knowledge transfer

## Appendix
-	MVP = Minimum Viable Product
-	NPO = Non-Profit Organization
